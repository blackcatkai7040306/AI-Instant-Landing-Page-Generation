# Financial Management System

## About The Project
SimplyBudget AI is a financial management tool that utilizes artificial intelligence. It is designed to improve your budgeting experience and assist you in achieving financial freedom.

Key technical challenges addressed:
- Implemented idempotent transaction processing to handle network failures
- Developed reconciliation algorithms for cross-system data validation
- Built custom encryption for sensitive financial data at rest and in transit

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **Transaction Processor**
   - Handles concurrent write operations
   - Implements optimistic locking to prevent race conditions
   - Uses two-phase commit for distributed transactions

2. **Data Validation Engine**
   - Schema validation with JSON Schema
   - Business rule validation (amount limits, frequency checks)
   - Reference data lookups against external systems

3. **Reporting Module**
   - Daily batch processing (windowed aggregation)
   - Real-time dashboards via WebSockets
   - PDF/Excel export capabilities

### Technical Challenges
- **Data Consistency**: Solved with event sourcing pattern
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Added Redis caching layer
- **Security Requirements**: Implemented PCI DSS compliant logging
- **Integration Issues**: Built adapter pattern for bank APIs
